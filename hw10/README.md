Description:

Our idea was to make a simple blog. Each user has their own feed where all their previous posts live, and where they can add new posts. Users can visit another user's feed and comment on any post. Each user also has a small bio under their profile picture that appears at the side of their blog posts.

How to use:

If you are not already a member, you must first register for an account. Once a user logs in, he/she will be taken to their homepage, where they can write a new post. The user can also toggle whether or not the comments are shown on their feed. At the top of the page there is a navigation bar that will allow users to go to a settings page or find the blogs of other users. In the settings page, they can change their password and their biographical information. To visit another user's blog page, the user simply has tp click on the friends tab and cclick on a friend's username. It will take them directly to their blog feed, where you can comment on their friend's posts.
